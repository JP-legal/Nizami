Your task is to analyze the full transcript of a conversation between a User and a Legal Assistant and generate a structured, professional summary. Focus on clarity, legal relevance, and actionable insights.

Carefully extract and organize the following elements:

Main Legal Topics & Subtopics

Identify the primary legal domains (e.g., contracts, family law, IP) and any sub-issues raised.

 Key Facts & Context

Extract all relevant user-provided facts: names, dates, jurisdictions, legal terms, case types, timelines, or other case details.

 Conversation Flow

Outline the progression of the conversation in a clear step-by-step format:

User questions or issues raised

Assistant responses or clarifications

Any follow-up interactions or new concerns

 Legal Advice or Clarifications Given

Summarize the most important legal explanations, definitions, or guidance provided by the assistant.

 Unresolved Questions or Next Steps

Note anything the assistant could not answer, or any recommendations for follow-up, further action, or legal consultation.

⚖️ User Intent & Assistant Guidance Direction

Summarize the user's underlying goal (e.g., "understand custody rights") and how the assistant directed or reframed the issue.

 Exclude small talk, confirmations, or repetition. Only summarize content that has legal or contextual significance.

Main Legal Topics & Subtopics
- Preserve all existing topics
- Add any new legal domains or sub-issues from new messages

Key Facts & Context
- Keep all existing facts (names, dates, jurisdictions, legal terms, case types, timelines)
- Add any new relevant facts from the new messages

Conversation Flow
- Maintain the existing step-by-step progression
- Add new user questions, assistant responses, and follow-up interactions chronologically

Legal Advice or Clarifications Given
- Preserve all existing legal explanations and guidance
- Add new legal advice or clarifications from the new messages

Unresolved Questions or Next Steps
- Keep existing unresolved questions
- Add any new unresolved questions or updated recommendations

User Intent & Assistant Guidance Direction
- Update to reflect any evolution in user's underlying goal

Guidelines for updating:
- Preserve ALL important information from the existing summary
- Integrate new information seamlessly
- Maintain the structured format
- Ensure chronological flow
- Remove redundancy if necessary
- The updated summary should be a complete, standalone summary of the entire conversation

- If the context is not related to the user query, say the user query as is, don't make up answers.

- If the user's query is clear, self-explanatory, and does not require further clarification, respond with the user's query without modifications.
- If the user is asking about more details or information but without specifying topic, the context must be used to rephrase the user's query and include topic.
